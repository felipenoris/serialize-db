# Threads, the GIL and the batch boundary

Read before `stream`, `loader`, `max_workers`, any helper thread, or a change in how batches cross the library's boundary. Each fact ends with the `plan/` file that details it, and `tests/proof_of_concept/` holds the API details as assertions. A fact found in a session is appended here, under the heading it belongs to.

- `duckdb` and `redshift_connector` declare DB-API `threadsafety` 1: threads share the module, never a
  connection. DuckDB, delta-rs and PyArrow release the GIL during native work (a Python loop in
  another thread kept 94% to 101% of its rate, 2026-09-20, macOS), so `ThreadPoolExecutor` gives real
  parallelism without Rust: two `write_deltalake` into distinct tables took 0.10 s in two threads
  against 0.21 s in sequence. A DuckDB connection shared by two threads hands one thread the other's
  result without error; `con.cursor()` per thread shares the database, two in-memory `connect()` are
  separate databases, a second `connect(path)` with another config or `read_only` raises
  `ConnectionException`, and `threads` belongs to the instance, not the cursor. Delta readers keep
  the version they loaded while an `append` commits. A native call that releases and reacquires the GIL
  beside a thread running pure Python waits the switch interval per reacquisition: 200 `os.stat` took
  0.3 s against 0.2 ms alone (0.035 s with `sys.setswitchinterval(0.0005)`), and the lazy
  `import pyarrow.dataset` inside the first `pq.read_table` took 15 s against 0.19 s; import at
  startup and keep hot pure-Python loops out of the library's threads. `plan/PLAN.md`, section "A troca de dados com o
  código cliente", records the decisions of 2026-09-20. `tests/proof_of_concept/test_concurrency.py`, `test_parallel.py`
- The client boundary by batches (2026-09-20, macOS arm64, DuckDB 1.5.5 with `threads = 2`): a
  `to_arrow_reader` on its own `cursor()` delivers its query's snapshot while other cursors insert
  into the same table and change the catalog, and closing that cursor mid-stream did not stop it;
  100 `cursor()` plus `close()` took 0.4 ms. 20,000,000 rows: `to_arrow_table` 0.59 s at 567 MB of
  process, `to_arrow_reader(100_000)` 0.54 s at 83 MB, first batch in 3 ms without `ORDER BY` and
  after the whole sort (2.4 s) with it. A prefetch thread hid the client's per-batch work: 1.25x
  with pandas work, 1.55x with a pure-Python loop. Writes of 6,000,000 rows in 100,000-row batches:
  one `INSERT` over a queue-fed reader 0.20 s, one `INSERT` per batch in one transaction on a helper
  thread 0.41 s (about 3.5 ms per statement, nothing visible before `commit`, `rollback` on failure
  leaves 0 rows). DuckDB's `arrow_scan` pulls a registered Python stream through an Arrow readahead
  thread (`BackgroundGenerator`) that ran the generator on another thread, had pulled 5 to 15
  batches when the `INSERT` failed on the first and reached 10 to 20 after the failure.
  `RecordBatchReader.from_batches` does not check its batches: swapped columns entered DuckDB as
  `(4607182418800017408, 5e-324)` for `(1, 1.0)`; `read_all` raises `Schema at index 0 was
  different`; `RecordBatch.cast` refuses what `Table.cast` refuses; `RecordBatchReader.close()` does
  not close a generator-backed reader. `to_batches`/`from_batches`/`RecordBatch.to_pandas(ArrowDtype)`/
  `RecordBatch.from_pandas` share buffers (0.04 ms, 0.003 ms, 1.4 ms, 0.5 ms). A mid-read query
  error reaches Python as `OSError` with DuckDB's message. Objects with `__arrow_c_stream__` are
  accepted by `from_stream`, DuckDB `register` and `write_deltalake`. `plan/PLAN.md`, `plan/POC.md`,
  `plan/duckdb.md`, `tests/proof_of_concept/test_duckdb.py`, `test_pyarrow.py`, `test_parallel.py`
- The Redshift engine keeps one session per execution under a `threading.Lock` (user decision of
  2026-09-22), no connection per thread: `stream` takes the lock for `execute` only, because the
  driver materializes the result there, `loader` writes the Parquet outside it and `COPY`s under
  it, `ingest(max_workers)` serializes on that engine and `publish_redshift` keeps a connection
  per table. A DuckDB temporary table is per connection and `cursor()` is a new connection
  (2026-09-22), so the DuckDB engine keeps its cursor per thread, stream and loader, and both
  sandboxes use regular tables. `plan/PLAN.md`, `plan/PLAN-STAGE-5.md`, `plan/POC.md`
